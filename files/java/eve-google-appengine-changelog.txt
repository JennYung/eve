2012-09-07, version 0.6

- Created a record logger to log requests to agents (DatastoreRequestLogger).
  Not yet in use though.
- Changed the behavior of the DatastoreContext: The DatastoreContext now
  uses MemCache during a request for read/writing properties, and only writes
  to the Datastore once at the end when the context is changed.
  Because the context is synchronized to the MemCache, multiple instances of
  the same agent can execute requests simultaneously with only little change of
  conflicts.
- Added methods to the DatastoreContext required by EveCore to route requests
  to local agents internally.


2012-07-03, version 0.5

- Updated the context to reflect changes in EveCore
- DatastoreContext now stores one entity per agent, instead of one per 
  parameter. It remains to be seen what works more efficient from a Datastore
  point of view.


2012-06-08, version 0.4

- Context adjusted:
  - return type must now be provided when getting a parameter
  - put method now returns a boolean with the success value.
